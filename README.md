# Fundus-Image-Disease-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
The aim of this project is to build a deep learning network which can classify retinal images into 4 types i.e. Diabetic retinopathy, AMD, Glaucoma and normal eye.
Fundus Image: A fundus image refers to a image of the interior surface of the eye, particularly focusing on the retina, optic disc, macula, and blood vessels. The image is used to help diagnose various eye conditions.
Dataset: It is manually created by gathering dataset for each disease from various sites.
